# TaskZen
my first "to-do app".with broken css 
I tried to make it modular i dont know why

## Features
- Add tasks (sometimes)
- Remove tasks (if the code feels like it)
- "Modular design" (in quotes for a reason)
- Looks Good

## Why does this repo exist?
Because every developer has a to-do app.  
This one just happens to be mine.
